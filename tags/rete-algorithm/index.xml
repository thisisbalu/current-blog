      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rete Algorithm has different enhanced form of variations. Charles L. Forgy had worked on three versions which exhibited more performance and fastness in the systems. They are Rete II, Rete III, and Rete NT. Although there are other enhanced versions of Rete by different vendors like RetePlus by IBM and ReteOO by RedHat, they are not considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rete Algorithm is an efficient pattern matching algorithm that compares a large collection of patterns to a large collection of objects. It was invented by Charles L. Forgy and documented in his Ph.D. thesis in 1978-79 at Carnegie-Mellon University. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
