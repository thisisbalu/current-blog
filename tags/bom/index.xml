      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Execution Object Model (XOM) is the model against which the rules run. It references the application objects and data and is the base implementation of the Business Object Model (BOM). Rule projects reference the XOM. Through the Execution Object Model, the rule engine can access application objects and methods, which can be Java objects, XML data, or data from other sources. At run time, rules that were written against the BOM are run against the XOM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
