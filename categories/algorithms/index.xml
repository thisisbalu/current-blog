      <description>&lt;p&gt;RetePlus algorithm is one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.balasubramanyamlanka.com/rule-engine-execution-modes/&#34;&gt;execution modes&lt;/a&gt; in IBM ODM which is based on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.balasubramanyamlanka.com/rete-algorithm/&#34;&gt;Rete algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. It works based on working memory, agenda creation, supports negative patterns, object notification, and Logical Objects. Use RetePlus optimization techniques to improve performance through reduction of the number of rules and conditions, computation of the rules to run, and prioritization of the rule order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Different Versions of Rete Algorithm</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rete Algorithm has different enhanced form of variations. Charles L. Forgy had worked on three versions which exhibited more performance and fastness in the systems. They are Rete II, Rete III, and Rete NT. Although there are other enhanced versions of Rete by different vendors like RetePlus by IBM and ReteOO by RedHat, they are not considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rule Engine Execution Mode – Choosing and Setting in ODM</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IBM Operational Decision Management has three Rule Engine &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.balasubramanyamlanka.com/rule-engine-execution-modes/&#34;&gt;Execution modes&lt;/a&gt;. The tricky part comes while choosing the appropriate execution mode for the rules in the rule task. To choose the correct execution mode, we should consider all the rules in the rule task. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rete Algorithm is an efficient pattern matching algorithm that compares a large collection of patterns to a large collection of objects. It was invented by Charles L. Forgy and documented in his Ph.D. thesis in 1978-79 at Carnegie-Mellon University. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
